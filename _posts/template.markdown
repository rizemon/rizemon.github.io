# Configuration

The operating system that I will be using to tackle this machine is a Kali Linux VM.

What I learnt from other writeups is that it was a good habit to map a domain name to the machine's IP address so as that it will be easier to remember. This can done by appending a line to `/etc/hosts`.

```bash
$ echo "10.10.10.<> <>.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

# Reconnaissance

```bash 

```

# Enumeration (1)

## Port 80 

# Exploitation (1)

# user.txt

# Enumeration (2)

# Exploitation (2)

# root.txt


### Rooted ! Thank you for reading and look forward for more writeups and articles !
