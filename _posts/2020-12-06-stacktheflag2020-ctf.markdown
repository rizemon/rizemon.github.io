Participated in the STACK the Flags CTF with my peers and placed 10th in the University / Polytechnic category. Here's the [link](https://dame-dango.github.io/STACKtheFlags2020/index.html) to the writeup. I mostly solved the cloud, osint and social engineering challenges but wanted to score some in the web category. In the end, it was a great team effort :laughing:
