# Introduction

[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) was promoting their brand new [`Pre Security` learning path](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity), which was aimed at learning the basics of cyber security in a much beginner friendly way. I ain't exactly a beginner, but the prizes to be won were just too attractive so I immediately bought the premium subscription. Fortunately, I was still a student, so I was able to enjoy the `20%` discount!

# Linux Fundamentals

## Room 11: [Linux Fundamentals Part 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1)

### Task 3: Interacting With Your First Linux Machine (In-Browser)

I didn't see the `Start Machine` button on the top right of the task, so I immediately clicked on the `Start AttackBox` button out of habit and I was wondering why I couldn't get the answers haha. 

## Room 12: [Linux Fundamentals Part 2](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart2)

### Task 2: Accessing Your Linux Machine Using SSH (Deploy) 

Okay, for this room will need to both start the machine and our `AttackBox`, or you could use `VPN` to connect to THM's network if you are feeling brave.

### Task 6: Accessing Your Linux Machine Using SSH (Deploy)

I did not know you could put `@reboot` in of the typical `cron` syntax in order to set a command to be executed at reboot!

# Windows Fundamentals

## Room 14: [Windows Fundamentals 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals1xbx)

## Room 15: [Windows Fundamentals 2](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals2x0x)

These 2 rooms introduced various default Windows programs which I didn't know existed and these programs were able to provide many useful information about the Windows system that they are ran on.

# Reflection

After going through all 15 rooms, I felt that the flow was awesome, perfectly touching every basic concept that a beginner needs to know to kickstart their interest or career in cyber security. Honestly, I wished this path was created much earlier. Before, it was very easy to get lost or even get daunted by the amount of content and the path really does a great job by removing the need of going through the technical setup of a learning environment and removing any extra information that a begineer doesn't need to see at that point of time.
